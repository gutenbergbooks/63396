<p><i>But from these immense prairies may arise one great
advantage to the United States, viz., the restriction of our
population to some certain limits, and thereby a
continuation of the union. Our citizens being so prone to
rambling, and extending themselves on the frontiers, will,
through necessity, be constrained to limit their extent on
the west to the borders of the Missouri and the
Mississippi, while they leave the prairies, incapable of
cultivation, to the wandering and uncivilized Aborigines of
the country.</i>

<p>Exploratory Travels Through The Western Territories of North America comprising
a voyage from St. Louis, on the Mississippi, to the source of that river,
and a journey through the interior of Louisiana and the north-eastern provinces
of New Spain. Performed in the years 1805, 1806, and 1807, by order of the
Government of the United States. By Zebulon Montgomery Pike. Published by
Paternoster-Row, London, 1811: W. H. Lawrence and Company, Denver, 1889.

<br />The GREAT PLAINS</span></h1>
<p class="center"><span class="ssn">By Donald E. Trimble</span></p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>The Great Plains! The words alone create a sense of space
and a feeling of destiny&mdash;a challenge. But what exactly is this
special part of Western America that contains so much of our
history? How did it come to be? Why is it different?</p>
<p>Geographically, the Great Plains is an immense sweep of
country; it reaches from Mexico far north into Canada and
spreads out east of the Rocky Mountains like a huge welcome
mat. So often maligned as a drab, featureless area, the
Great Plains is in fact a land of marked contrasts and limitless
variety: canyons carved into solid rock of an arid land
by the waters of the Pecos and the Rio Grande; the seemingly
endless grainfields of Kansas; the desolation of the Badlands;
the beauty of the Black Hills.</p>
<p>Before it was broken by the plow, most of the Great Plains
from the Texas panhandle northward was treeless grassland.
Trees grew only along the floodplains of streams and on the
few mountain masses of the northern Great Plains. These
lush prairies once were the grazing ground for immense herds
of bison, and the land provided a bountiful life for those
Indians who followed the herds. South of the grasslands, in
Texas, shrubs mixed with the grasses: creosote bush along
the valley of the Pecos River; mesquite, oak, and juniper to
the east.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The general lack of trees suggests that this is a land of little
moisture, as indeed it is. Nearly all of the Great Plains
receives less than 24 inches of rainfall a year, and most of it
receives less than 16 inches. This dryness and the strength of
sunshine in this area, which lies mostly between 2,000 and
6,000 feet above sea level, create the semiarid environment
that typifies the Great Plains. But it was not always so.
When the last continental glacier stood near its maximum
extent, some 12,000-14,000 years ago, spruce forest reached
southward as far as Kansas, and the Great Plains farther
south was covered by deciduous forest. The trees retreated
northward as the ice front receded, and the Great Plains has
been a treeless grassland for the last 8,000-10,000 years.</p>
<p>For more than half a century after Lewis and Clark crossed
the country in 1805-6, the Great Plains was the testing
ground of frontier America&mdash;here America grew to maturity
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). In 1805-7, explorer Zebulon Pike crossed the south-central
Great Plains, following the Arkansas River from near
Great Bend, Kans., to the Rocky Mountains. In later years,
Santa Fe traders, lured by the wealth of New Mexican trade,
followed Pike&rsquo;s path as far as Bents Fort, Colo., where they
turned southwestward away from the river route. Those pioneers
who later crossed the plains on the Oregon Trail
reached the Platte River near the place that would become
Kearney, Nebr., by a nearly direct route from Independence,
Mo., and followed the Platte across the central part of the
Great Plains.</p>
<p>Although these routes may have seemed long and tedious
to those dusty travelers, they provided relatively easy access
to the Rocky Mountains and had a continuous supply of
fresh water, an absolute necessity in these plains. The minds
of those frontiersmen surely were occupied with the dangers
and demands of the moment&mdash;and with dreams&mdash;but the
time afforded by the slow pace of travel also gave them
ample opportunity for thought about the origins of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s traveler, who has less time for contemplation,
races past a changing kaleidoscope of landscape. The increased
awareness created by this rapidity of change perhaps
is even more likely to stimulate questions about the origin of
this landscape.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>For instance, the westbound traveler on Interstate
Highway 70 traverses nearly a thousand miles of low,
rounded hills after leaving the Appalachians; the rolling
landscape is broken only by a few flat areas where glacial ice
or small lakes once stood. Suddenly, near Salina, Kans., the
observant traveler senses a difference in the landscape.
Instead of rounded hills, widely or closely spaced, he sees on
the skyline flat surfaces, or remnants of flat surfaces. As he
climbs gently westward these broken horizontal lines stand
etched against the sky. About 35 miles west of Salina he finds
himself on a broad, flat plateau, where seemingly he can see
forever. True, in places he descends into stream valleys, but
only briefly, for he soon climbs back onto the flat surface.</p>
<p>This plateau surface continues for 300 miles to the west&mdash;to
within 100 miles of the abrupt front of the Rocky Mountains.
East-flowing streams, such as the Smoky Hill, the
Saline, the Solomon, and the Republican Rivers and their
tributary branches, have cut their valleys into this surface,
but these valleys become increasingly shallow and disappear
entirely near the western rim of the plateau in eastern Colorado.</p>
<p>The distant peaks of the Rockies are seen for the first time
as the traveler approaches the escarpment that forms the
western edge of this great plateau. After crossing the escarpment
near Limon, Colo., he begins the long gentle descent to
Denver, on the South Platte River near the foot of the mountains
that loom so awesomely ahead. He has crossed the
Great Plains. The distances have been great, but the contrasts
have been marked.</p>
<p>Had our traveler selected a different route, either to the
north or south, he would have found even greater contrasts,
for the Great Plains has many parts, each with its own distinctive
aspect. Why should such diverse landscapes be
considered parts of the Great Plains? What are their unifying
features? And what created this landscape? Has it always
been this way? If not, when was it formed? How was it
formed?</p>
<p>We will look here at some of the answers to those questions.
The history of events that produced the landscape of
the Great Plains is interpreted both from the materials that
compose the landforms and from the landforms themselves.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
As we will see, all landforms are the result of geologic
processes in action. These processes determine not only the
size and shape of the landforms, but also the materials of
which they are made. These geologic processes, which form
and shape our Earth&rsquo;s surface, are simply the inevitable
actions of the restless interior of the Earth and of the air,
water, and carbon dioxide of the atmosphere, aided by
gravity and solar heating (or lack of it). They all have helped
sculpture the fascinating diversity of the part of our land we
call the Great Plains.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">WHAT IS THE GREAT PLAINS?</span></h2>
<p>The United States has been subdivided into physiographic
regions that, although they have great diversity within themselves,
are distinctly different from each other (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>From the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Appalachians
on the east, the interior of our country is a vast
lowland (see <a href="#coverpage">cover</a>) known as the Interior Plains. These
plains are bounded on the south by a region of Interior Highlands,
consisting of the Ozark Plateaus and the Ouachita
province, and by the Coastal Plain. In the Great Lakes
region, the Interior Plains laps onto the most ancient part of
the continent, the Superior Upland. West of the Great Lakes
it extends far to the north into Canada. Certainly the Rocky
Mountains are distinctly different from the region to the east,
which is the Great Plains. The Great Plains, then, is the
western part of the great Interior Plains. The Rocky Mountains
form its western margin. But what determines its
eastern margin?</p>
<p>During the Pleistocene Epoch or Great Ice Age, huge glaciers
formed in Canada and advanced southward into the
great, central, low-lying Interior Plains of the United States.
(See <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>.) These glaciers and their deposits modified the
surface of the land they covered, mostly between the Missouri
and the Ohio Rivers; they smoothed the contours and
gave the land a more subdued aspect than it had before they
came. This glacially smoothed and modified land is called
the Central Lowland. Although the ice sheets lapped onto the
northern part, the Great Plains is the largely unglaciated
region that extends from the Gulf Coastal Plain in Texas
northward into Canada between the Central Lowland and
the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Its eastern margin in Texas
and Oklahoma is marked by a prominent escarpment, the
Caprock escarpment. Its southern margin, where it abuts the
Coastal Plain in Texas, is at another abrupt rise or scarp
along the Balcones fault zone.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">THE GREAT PLAINS&mdash;ITS PARTS</span></h2>
<p>Within the Great Plains are many large areas that differ
greatly from adjoining areas (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The Black Hills stands
out distinctively from the surrounding lower land, and its
dark, forested prominence can be seen for scores of miles
from any direction. At the southern end of the Great Plains is
another, less imposing, forested prominence&mdash;the Central
Texas Uplift. Most impressive, perhaps, is the huge, nearly
flat plateau known as the High Plains, which extends southward
from the northern border of Nebraska through the
Panhandle of Texas, and which forms the central part of the
Great Plains. The east and west rims of the southern High
Plains are at high, cliffed, erosional escarpments&mdash;the Caprock
escarpment on the east and the Mescalero escarpment
on the west. The north edge of the High Plains is defined by
another escarpment, the Pine Ridge escarpment, which separates
the High Plains from a region that has been greatly dissected
by the Missouri River and its tributaries. There,
several levels of rolling upland are surmounted by small
mountainous masses and flat-topped buttes and are entrenched
by streams. This region is the Missouri Plateau. The
continental glacier lapped onto the northeastern part of the
Missouri Plateau and altered its surface.</p>
<p>The South Platte and Arkansas Rivers and their tributaries
have similarly dissected an area along the mountain front
that is called the Colorado Piedmont, and the Pecos River
has excavated a broad valley trending southward from the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico into Texas. The
Mescalero escarpment separates the Pecos Valley from the
southern High Plains (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). South and east of the Pecos
Valley, extending to the Rio Grande and the Coastal Plain, is
a broad plateau of bare, stripped, flat-lying limestone layers
bearing little but cactus that is called the Edwards Plateau.
Green, crop-filled valleys with gently sloping valley walls
and rounded stream divides trend eastward from the High
Plains of western Kansas and characterize a Plains Border
section. And finally, between the Colorado Piedmont on the
north and the Pecos Valley on the south, volcanic vents,
cinder cones, and lava fields form another distinctive terrain
in the part of the Great Plains called the Raton section.</p>

<p>Can such diverse parts of our land have a sufficiently
common origin to justify their being considered part of one
unified whole&mdash;the Great Plains? Probably so, but to understand
why, we must examine some of the earlier geologic
history of the Great Plains as well as subsequent events revealed
in the present landforms. We will find that all parts of
this region we call the Great Plains have a similar early
history, and that the differences we see are the results of local
dominance of certain processes in the ultimate shaping of the
landscape, mostly during the last few million years. The distinctive
character of the landscape in each section is determined
in part by both the early events and the later shaping
processes.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">EARLY HISTORY</span></h2>
<p>The Interior Plains, of which the Great Plains is the
western, mostly unglaciated part (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>), is the least complicated
part of our continent geologically except for the
Coastal Plain. For most of the half billion years from 570
million (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) until about 70 million years ago, shallow seas
lay across the interior of our continent (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). A thick
sequence of layered sediments, mostly between 5,000 and
10,000 feet thick, but more in places, was deposited onto the
subsiding floor of the interior ocean (<a href="#table1">table 1</a>). These sediments,
now consolidated into rock, rest on a floor of very
old rocks that are much like the ancient rocks of the Superior
Upland.</p>
<p>About 70 million years ago the seas were displaced from
the continental interior by slow uplift of the continent, and
the landscape that appeared was simply the extensive, nearly
flat floor of the former sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">WARPING AND STREAM DEPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>Most of these rocks of marine origin lie at considerable
depth beneath the land surface, concealed by an overlying
thick, layered sequence of rocks laid down by streams, wind,
and glaciers. Nevertheless, their geologic character, position,
and form are exceptionally well known from information
gained from thousands of wells that have been drilled for oil.
The initial, nearly horizontal position of the layers of rock
beneath the Interior Plains has been little disturbed except
where mountains like the Black Hills were uplifted about 70
million years ago. At those places, which are all in the northern
and southern parts of the Great Plains, the sedimentary
layers have been warped up and locally broken by the rise of
hot molten rock from depth. Elsewhere in the Interior Plains,
however, earth forces of about the same period caused only a
reemphasis of gentle undulations in the Earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>
<p>These undulations affected both the older basement rocks
and the overlying sedimentary rocks, and they take the form
of gentle basins and arches that in some places span several
States. (See sketch map, <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>.) A series of narrow basins
lies along the mountain front on the west side of the Great
Plains. A broad, discontinuous arch extends southwest from
the Superior Upland to the Rocky Mountain front to form a
buried divide that separates the large Williston basin on the
north from the Anadarko basin to the south.</p>
<p>While the flat-lying layers of the Interior Plains were being
only gently warped, vastly different earth movements were
taking place farther west, in the area of the present Rocky
Mountains. Along a relatively narrow north-trending belt,
extending from Mexico to Alaska, the land was being
uplifted at a great rate. The layers of sedimentary rock deposited
in the inland sea were stripped from the crest of the
rising mountainous belt by erosion and transported to its
flanks as the gravel, sand, and mud of streams and rivers.
This transported sediment was deposited on the plains to
form the rocks of the Cretaceous Hell Creek, Lance,
Laramie, Vermejo, and Raton Formations. Vegetation
thrived on this alluvial plain, and thick accumulations of
woody debris were buried to ultimately become coal. This
lush vegetation provided ample food for the hordes of three-horned
dinosaurs (<i>Triceratops</i>) that roamed these plains.
Their fossilized remains are found from Canada to New
Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="ssn">The Earth is very old&mdash;4.5 billion years or more according to
recent estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>As the mountains continued to rise, the eroding streams
cut into the old core rocks of the mountains, and that debris
too was carried to the flanks and onto the adjoining plains.
The mountainous belt continued to rise intermittently, and
volcanoes began to appear about 50 million years ago. Together,
the mountains and volcanoes provided huge quantities
of sediment, which the streams transported to the
plains and deposited. The areas nearest the mountains were
covered by sediments of Late Cretaceous and Paleocene age
(<a href="#table1">table 1</a>)&mdash;the Poison Canyon Formation to the south, the
Dawson and Denver Formations in the Denver area, and the
Fort Union Formation to the north (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Vegetation continued
to flourish, especially in the northern part of the Great
Plains, and was buried to form the thick lignite and subbituminous
coal beds of the Fort Union Formation (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). The
earliest mammals, most of whose remains come from the
Paleocene Fort Union Formation, have few modern survivors.</p>
<p>Beginning about 45 million years ago, in Eocene time,
there was a long period of stability lasting perhaps 10 million
years, when there was little uplift of the mountains and,
therefore, little deposition on the plains. A widespread and
strongly developed soil formed over much of the Great
Plains during this period of stability. With renewed uplift
and volcanism in the mountains at the end of this period,
great quantities of sediment again were carried to the
plains by streams and spread over the northern Great Plains
and southeastward to the arch or divide separating the
Williston and Anadarko basins (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Those sediments
form the White River Group, in which the South Dakota
Badlands are carved. In addition to the <i>Titanotheres</i>, huge
beasts with large, long horns on their snouts who lived only
during the Oligocene (37 to 22 million years ago), vast herds
of camels, rhinoceroses, horses, and tapirs&mdash;animals now
found native only on other continents&mdash;grazed those Oligocene
semiarid grassland plains.</p>

<p>Sometime between 20 and 30 million years ago the streams
began depositing sand and gravel beyond the divide, and, for
another 10 million years or more, stream sediments of the
Arikaree and Ogallala Formations spread over the entire
Great Plains from Canada to Texas, except where mountainous
areas such as the Black Hills stood above the plains.
Between 5 and 10 million years ago, then, the entire Great
Plains was an eastward-sloping depositional plain surmounted
only by a few mountain masses. Horses, camels,
rhinoceroses, and a strange horselike creature with clawed
feet (called <i>Moropus</i>) lived on this plain.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">SCULPTURING THE LAND</span></h2>
<p>Sometime between 5 and 10 million years ago, however, a
great change took place, apparently as a result of regional
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
uplift of the entire western part of the continent. While
before, the streams had been depositing sediment on the
plains for more than 60 million years, building up a huge
thickness of sedimentary rock layers, now the streams were
forced to cut down into and excavate the sediments they had
formerly deposited. As uplift continued&mdash;and it may still be
continuing&mdash;the streams cut deeper and deeper into the
layered stack and developed tributary systems that excavated
broad areas. High divides were left between streams in
some places, and broad plateaus were formed and remain in
other places. The great central area was essentially untouched
by erosion and remained standing above the dissected
areas surrounding it as the escarpment-rimmed
plateau that is the High Plains.</p>
<p>This downcutting and excavation by streams, then, which
began between 5 and 10 million years ago, roughed out the
landscape of the Great Plains and created the sections we call
the Missouri Plateau, the Colorado Piedmont, the Pecos
Valley, the Edwards Plateau, and the Plains Border Section.
Nearly all the individual landforms that now attract the eye
have been created by geologic processes during the last 2
million years. It truly is a young landscape.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">LANDFORMS OF TODAY&mdash;The surface features of the Great Plains</span></h2>
<p>The mountainous sections of the Great Plains were formed
long before the remaining areas were outlined by erosion.
Uplift of the Black Hills and the Central Texas Uplift began
as the continental interior was raised and the last Cretaceous
sea was displaced, 65 to 70 million years ago. They stood
well above the surrounding plains long before any sediments
from the distant Rocky Mountains began to accumulate at
their bases. In southern Colorado and northern New Mexico,
molten rock invaded the sedimentary layers between 22 and
26 million years ago. The Spanish Peaks were formed at this
time from hot magma that domed up the surface layers but
did not break through; the magma has since cooled and
solidified and has been exposed by erosion. Elsewhere the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
magma reached the surface, forming volcanoes, fissures, and
basalt flows. A great thickness of basalt flows accumulated
at Raton Mesa and Mesa de Maya between 8 and 2 million
years ago. Volcanism has continued intermittently, and the
huge cinder cone of Capulin Mountain was created by explosive
eruption only 10,000 to 4,000 years ago. Most of these
volcanic masses were formed before major downcutting by
the streams began. Other igneous intrusions and volcanic
areas in the northern Great Plains similarly were formed
before the streams were incised.</p>
<p>To examine the origin of the present landscape and of the
landforms typical of the various sections of the Great Plains,
it is convenient to begin with the Black Hills, the Central
Texas Uplift, and the Raton section simply because they were
formed first&mdash;they existed before the other sections were
outlined.</p>
<h3 id="c8">BLACK HILLS</h3>
<p>The Black Hills is a huge, elliptically domed area in northwestern
South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming, about
125 miles long and 65 miles wide (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). Rapid City, S.
Dak., is on the Missouri Plateau at the east edge of the Black
Hills. Uplift caused erosion to remove the overlying cover of
marine sedimentary rocks and expose the granite and metamorphic
rocks that form the core of the dome. The peaks of
the central part of the Black Hills presently are 3,000 to 4,000
feet above the surrounding plains. Harney Peak, with an altitude
of 7,242 feet, is the highest point in South Dakota.
These central spires and peaks all are carved from granite
and other igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the core
of the uplift. The heads of four of our great Presidents are
sculpted from this granite at Mount Rushmore National
Memorial. Joints in the rocks have controlled weathering
processes that influenced the final shaping of many of these
landforms. Closely spaced joints have produced the spires of
the Needles area, and widely spaced joints have produced the
rounded forms of granite that are seen near Sylvan Lake (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>).</p>
<p>Marine sedimentary rocks surrounding the old core rocks
form well-defined belts. Lying against the old core rocks and
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
completely surrounding them are Paleozoic limestones that
form the Limestone Plateau (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). These tilted layers have
steep erosional scarps facing the central part of the Black
Hills. Wind Cave and Jewel Cave were produced by ground
water dissolving these limestones along joints. These caves
are sufficiently impressive to be designated as a national park
and a national monument, respectively. Encircling the Limestone
Plateau is a continuous valley cut in soft Triassic shale.
This valley has been called &ldquo;the Racetrack,&rdquo; because of its
continuity, and the Red Valley, because of its color. Surrounding
the Red Valley is an outer hogback ridge formed by
the tilted layers of the Dakota Sandstone, which are quite
hard and resistant to erosion. Streams that flow from the
central part of the Black Hills pass through the Dakota
hogback in narrow gaps.</p>

<p>The Black Hills, then, is an uplifted area that has been
carved deeply but differentially by streams to produce its
major outlines. Those outlines have been modified mainly by
weathering of the ancient core rocks and solution of the limestone
of the Limestone Plateau.</p>
<h3 id="c9">CENTRAL TEXAS UPLIFT</h3>
<p>The domed rocks of the Central Texas Uplift form a topography
different from that of the Black Hills. Erosion of a
broad, uplifted dome here has exposed a core of old granites,
gneisses, and schists, as in the Black Hills, but in the Central
Texas Uplift, erosion has produced a topographic basin,
rather than high peaks and spires, on the old rocks of the
central area. A low plateau surface dissected into rounded
ridges and narrow valleys slopes gently eastward from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
edge of the central area to an escarpment at the Balcones
fault zone, which determines the eastern edge of the Great
Plains here. Northwest of the central basin the Colorado
River flows in a broad lowland about 100 miles long, but the
northern edge of the uplift, forming a divide between the
Brazos and the Colorado Rivers, is a series of mesas formed
of more resistant sandstone and limestone.</p>
<p>The cutting action of streams, modified or controlled in
part by differences in hardness of the rock layers, has been
responsible for the landforms of the Central Texas Uplift.
Weathering of the old core rocks has softened them sufficiently
to permit deeper erosion of the central area, and solution
of limestone by ground water has formed such features
as Longhorn Caverns, 11 miles southwest of Burnet, Tex.</p>
<h3 id="c10">RATON SECTION</h3>
<p>Volcanism characterizes the Raton section. The volcanic
rocks, which form peaks, mesas, and cones, have armored
the older sedimentary rocks and protected them from the
erosion that has cut deeply into the adjoining Colorado Piedmont
to the north and Pecos Valley to the south. The south
edge of the Raton section is marked by a spectacular south-facing
escarpment cut on the nearly flat-lying Dakota Sandstone.
This escarpment is the Canadian escarpment, north of
the Canadian River. Northward for about 100 miles, the
landscape is that of a nearly flat plateau cut on Cretaceous
rock surmounted here and there by young volcanic vents,
cones, and lava fields. Capulin Mountain is a cinder cone
only 10,000 to 4,000 years old (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). Near the New
Mexico-Colorado border, huge piles of lava were erupted 8
to 2 million years ago onto an older, higher surface on top of
either the Ogallala Formation of Miocene age or the Poison
Canyon Formation of Paleocene age. (See <a href="#table1">table 1</a>.) These
lava flows formed a resistant cap, which protected the underlying
rock from erosion while all the surrounding rock
washed away. The result is the high, flat-topped mesas, such
as Raton Mesa and Mesa de Maya (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>), that now form
the divide between the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers. At
Fishers Peak, on the west end of Raton Mesa, about 800 feet
of basalt flows rest on the Poison Canyon Formation at
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
about 8,800 feet in altitude. Farther east, on Mesa de Maya,
about 400 feet of basalt flows overlie the Ogallala Formation
at altitudes ranging from about 6,500 feet at the west end to
about 5,200 feet at the east end, some 35 miles to the east.
The Ogallala here rests on Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and
Purgatoire Formation, for the Poison Canyon Formation
was removed by erosion along the crest of a local uplift
before the Ogallala was deposited.</p>

</div>
<p>East of the belt of upturned sedimentary layers that form
the hogback ridges at the front of the Rocky Mountains, the
layered rocks in the Raton Basin have been intruded in many
places by igneous bodies, the two largest of which form the
Spanish Peaks (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>), southwest of Walsenburg, Colo.
These two peaks are formed by igneous bodies that were
intruded 26 to 22 million years ago and have since been
exposed by removal of the overlying sedimentary rock layers
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
by erosion. Radiating from the Spanish Peaks are hundreds
of dikes, nearly vertical slabs of igneous rock that filled fractures
radiating from the centers of intrusion. Erosion of the
sedimentary layers has left many of these dikes as conspicuous
vertical walls of igneous rock that project high above
the surrounding land surface. Some of these dikes north of
Trinidad, Colo. extend eastward for about 25 miles, almost
to the Purgatoire River.</p>

</div>
<p>The northern boundary of the Raton section is placed
somewhat indefinitely at the northern limit of the area injected
by igneous dikes. The eastern boundary of the Raton
section is at the eastern margin of the lavas of Mesa de Maya
and adjoining mesas, where lava-capped outliers of Ogallala
Formation are separated from the Ogallala of the High Plains
only by the canyon of Carrizo Creek.</p>
<h3 id="c11">HIGH PLAINS</h3>
<p>At the end of Ogallala deposition, some 5 million years
ago, the Great Plains, with the exception of the uplifted and
the volcanic areas, was a vast, gently sloping plain that
extended from the mountain front eastward to beyond the
present Missouri River in some places. Regional uplift of the
western part of the continent forced the streams to cut downward;
land near the mountains was stripped away by the
Missouri, the Platte, the Arkansas, and the Pecos Rivers, and
the eastern border of the plains was gnawed away by lesser
streams. A large central area of the plain is preserved,
however, essentially untouched and unaffected by the
streams, as a little-modified remnant of the depositional
surface of 5 million years ago. This Ogallala-capped preserved
remnant of that upraised surface is the High Plains. In
only one place does that old surface still extend to the mountains&mdash;at
the so-called &ldquo;Gangplank&rdquo; west of Cheyenne, Wyo.
(<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). In places, as at Scotts Bluff National Monument,
Nebr. (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>), small fragments of this surface have been isolated
from the High Plains by erosion and now stand above
the surrounding area as buttes.</p>

<p>The High Plains extends southward from the Pine Ridge
escarpment, near the South Dakota-Nebraska border (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>),
to the Edwards Plateau in Texas. The Platte, the
Arkansas, and the Canadian Rivers have cut through the
High Plains. That part of the High Plains south of the Canadian
River is called the Southern High Plains, or the Llano
Estacado (staked plain). The origin of this name is uncertain,
but it has been suggested that the term Llano Estacado was
applied by early travelers because this part of the High Plains
is so nearly flat and devoid of landmarks that it was necessary
for those pioneers to set lines of stakes to permit them to
retrace their routes.</p>
<p>The Llano Estacado is bounded on the west by the Mescalero
escarpment (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) and on the east by the Caprock
escarpment. The southern margin with the Edwards Plateau
is less well defined, but King Mountain, north of McCamey,
Tex., is a scarp-bounded southern promontory of the High
Plains. The remarkably flat surface of the Llano Estacado is
abundantly pitted by sinks and depressions in the surface of
the Ogallala Formation; these were formed by solution of the
limestone by rainwater and blowing away or deflation by
wind of the remaining insoluble particles. Many of these
solution-deflation depressions are aligned like strings of
beads, suggesting that their location is controlled by some
kind of underlying structure, such as intersections of joints in
the Ogallala Formation.</p>
<p>The solution-deflation depressions are less abundant north
of the Canadian River, but occur on the High Plains surface
northward to the Arkansas River and along the eastern part
of the High Plains north of the Arkansas to the South Fork of
the Republican River.</p>
<p>Covering much of the northern High Plains, however, are
sand dunes and windblown silt deposits (loess) that mantle
the Ogallala Formation and conceal any solution-deflation
depressions that might have formed. The Nebraska Sand
Hills (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>), the largest area of sand dunes in the western
hemisphere, is a huge area of stabilized sand dunes that
extends from the White River in South Dakota southward
beyond the Platte River almost to the Republican River in
western Nebraska but only to the Loup River in the northeast
part of the High Plains (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). Loess covers the western
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
High Plains southward from the sand dunes almost to the
Arkansas River, and to the South Fork of the Republican in
the eastern part. This extensive cover of loess has created a
fertile land that makes it an important part of America&rsquo;s
wheatlands (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="caption"><i>Figure 17.&mdash;Aerial view, looking northwest, of the Nebraska Sand
Hills west of Ashby, Nebr.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Other, smaller areas of sand dunes lie south of the Arkansas
River valley. The only large areas of sand dunes on the
Llano Estacado, or Southern High Plains, are along the
southwestern margin near Monahans, southwest of Odessa,
Tex.</p>
<p>Oil and gas are present in the Paleozoic rocks that underlie
the High Plains at depth. Gas fields are ubiquitous in much
of the eastern part of the High Plains between the Arkansas
and Canadian Rivers. Just south of the Canadian River, at
the northeast corner of the Southern High Plains, a huge oil
and gas field has been developed near Pampa, Tex. Oil and
gas fields also are abundant in the southwestern part of the
Southern High Plains, south of Littlefield, Tex.</p>

<p>The surface of the High Plains, then, has been little modified
by streams since the end of Ogallala deposition. It has
been raised by regional uplift and pitted by solution and
deflation, and large parts of it have been covered by wind-blown
sand and silt. It has been drilled for oil and gas and
extensively farmed, but it is still a geological rarity&mdash;a preserved
land surface that is 5 million years old.</p>
<h3 id="c12">MISSOURI PLATEAU</h3>
<p>Beginning about 5 million years ago, regional uplift of the
western part of the continent forced streams, which for 30
million years had been depositing sediment nearly continuously
on the Great Plains, to change their behavior and
begin to cut into the layers of sediment they so long had been
depositing. The predecessor of the Missouri River ate headward
into the northern Great Plains and developed a tributary
system that excavated deeply into the accumulated
deposits near the mountain front and carried away huge
volumes of sediment from the Great Plains to Hudson Bay.
By 2 million years ago, the streams had cut downward to
within a few hundred feet of their present level. This region
that has been so thoroughly dissected by the Missouri River
and its tributaries is called the Missouri Plateau.</p>
<p>About 2 million years ago, after much downcutting had already
taken place and river channels had been firmly established,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
great ice sheets advanced southward from Canada
into the United States. (See <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>.) These continental
glaciers formed, advanced, and retreated several times
during the last 2 million years. At the north and east margins
of the Missouri Plateau they lapped onto a high area, leaving
a mantle of glacial deposits covering the bedrock surface and
forcing streams to adopt new courses along the margin of ice.
The part of the Missouri Plateau covered by the continental
glaciers now is referred to as the Glaciated Missouri Plateau.
South of the part once covered by ice is the Unglaciated Missouri
Plateau.</p>
<h4 id="c13">Preglacial Drainage</h4>
<p>Before the initial advance of the continental ice sheets, the
Missouri River flowed northeastward into Canada and to
Hudson Bay. Its major tributaries, the Yellowstone and the
Little Missouri joined the Missouri in northwestern North
Dakota. The east-flowing Knife, Heart, and Cannonball
Rivers in North Dakota also joined a stream that flowed
northward to Hudson Bay.</p>
<h4 id="c14">Glaciated Missouri Plateau</h4>
<p>When the continental ice sheets spread southward into
northern Montana and the Dakotas, a few isolated areas in
Montana stood above the surrounding plain. These are
mostly areas that were uplifted by the intrusion of igneous
bodies long before the streams began downcutting and
carving the land. The northernmost of these isolated mountains,
the Sweetgrass Hills, were surrounded by ice and
became nunataks, or islands of land, in the sea of advancing
ice, which pushed southward up against the Highwood
Mountains, near Great Falls, the Bearpaws south of Havre,
and the Little Rockies to the east.</p>
<p>Much of the northern part of Montana is a plain of little
relief that is the surface of a nearly continuous cover of
glacial deposits, generally less than 50 feet thick. This plain
has been incised by the east-flowing postglacial Teton,
Marias, and Milk Rivers.</p>
<p>In North Dakota, a high area on the east side of the Williston
basin acted as a barrier to the advance of the ice, most of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
which was diverted southeastward. The margin of the ice
sheet, however, lapped onto the bedrock high, where it stagnated.
Earlier advances moved farthest south; the later advances
stopped north of the present course of the Missouri
River&mdash;their maximum position marked by ridges of unsorted,
glacially transported rock debris (till) called terminal
moraines. North of the terminal moraines is a distinctive
landscape characterized by a rolling, hummocky, or hilly
surface with thousands of closed depressions between the
hills and hummocks, most of them occupied by lakes. This is
the deposit left by the stagnant or dead ice, and it is called
dead-ice moraine. The rolling upland in North Dakota that is
covered by dead-ice moraine and ridges of terminal moraines
from the last glacial advances is called the Coteau du Missouri
(<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>). A gently sloping scarp, several hundred feet
high and mostly covered by glacial deposits (referred to collectively
as drift), separates the Coteau du Missouri from the
lower, nearly flat, drift-covered plains of the Central Lowland
to the east. This escarpment, which is called the Missouri
escarpment, is virtually continuous across the State of
North Dakota southward into South Dakota. The base of the
Missouri escarpment is the eastern boundary of the Great
Plains in these northern states.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The advancing ice front blocked one after another of the
northward-flowing streams of the region, diverting them
eastward along the ice front. Shonkin Sag, north of the Highwood
Mountains near Great Falls, Mont., is an abandoned
diversion channel of the Missouri River, occupied when the
ice front stood close to the north slopes of the Highwoods.
Much of the present course of the Missouri River from Great
Falls, Mont., to Kansas City, Mo., was established as an ice-marginal
channel, and the east-flowing part of the Little Missouri
River in North Dakota was formed in the same way.
These valleys were cut during the last 2 million years.</p>
<p>The north-flowing part of the Little Missouri River and the
east-flowing courses of the Knife, Heart, and Cannonball
Rivers in North Dakota are for the most part older, preglacial
courses. The Little Missouri was dammed by the ice,
and its waters impounded to form a huge lake during the
maximum stand of the ice, but the deposits of this glacial
lake are few and make no imprint on the landscape.</p>
<p>The valley of the east-flowing, glacially diverted part of
the Little Missouri River, however, is markedly different
from that of the north-flowing preglacial river. It is much
narrower and has steeper walls than the old valley. Because
it is younger, it is little modified, except by huge landslides
that have affected both walls of the valley. Tremendous
rotated landslide blocks in the North Unit of Theodore
Roosevelt National Memorial Park are some of the best
examples of the slump type of landslide to be seen anywhere
(<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>).</p>
<p>Melting ice at the front of the glaciers provided large
volumes of meltwater that flowed across the till-mantled
surface in front of the glacier as it melted back toward
Canada. This meltwater took many courses to join the glacially
diverted Missouri River, and these sinuous meltwater
channels wind across the dead-ice moraine and the older, less
hummocky ground moraine between the Coteau du Missouri
and the Missouri River. Locally the sediment carried by the
meltwater streams was banked against a wall of ice to form a
small hill of stratified drift that is called a kame. Streams
flowing in tunnels beneath the ice formed sinuous, ridgelike
deposits called eskers, and in places the meltwater deposits
form broad flat areas called outwash plains.</p>

<p>This rather limited variety of landforms, then, characterizes
the landscape of the Glaciated Missouri Plateau. The
landforms themselves are testimony to their glacial origin
and to the great advances of the continental ice sheets. This is
a stream-carved terrain that has been modified by continental
glaciers and almost completely covered by a thick
blanket of glacially transported and deposited rock debris,
locally hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent stream action has
not altered the landscape greatly.</p>
<h4 id="c15">Unglaciated Missouri Plateau</h4>
<p>Beyond the limits reached by the ice of the continental glaciers,
the Unglaciated Missouri Plateau displays the greatest
variety of landforms of any section of the Great Plains. In
western Montana, many small mountain masses rise above
the general level of the plateau, including the Highwood,
Bearpaw, and Little Rocky Mountains near the margin of the
glaciated area, and the Judith, Big Snowy, Big Belt, Little
Belt, Castle, and Crazy Mountains farther south (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>).
Many of these, such as the Crazy, Castle, Judith, and Big
Snowy Mountains, are areas uplifted by large, deeply
rooted, intrusive igneous bodies called stocks, which have
been exposed by subsequent erosion of the arched overlying
sedimentary rock layers. Some, such as the Highwood and
Bearpaw Mountains, are predominantly piles of lava flows,
although in the Bearpaws the related intrusive bodies of
igneous rock form a part of the mountains. The Big and Little
Belt Mountains were formed by mushroom-shaped intrusive
igneous bodies called laccoliths, which have spread out and
domed between layers of sedimentary rocks. A number of
igneous bodies also intrude the rocks of the Missouri Plateau
around the periphery of the Black Hills. Devils Tower, the
first feature to be designated a National Monument, is the
best known of these igneous rock features (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>The uplift and volcanism that formed these mountains
took place before the streams began to cut downward and
segment the Great Plains. The mountains had been greatly
dissected before the advent of the Great Ice Age, when alpine
glaciers formed on the Castle and the Crazy Mountains and
flowed down some of the stream-cut valleys. Alpine glacial
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
features such as cirques, in the high parts of the mountains,
and glacially modified U-shaped valleys (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>) are impressive
evidence of this glaciation.</p>

</div>
<p>The Missouri River and its tributaries&mdash;the Sun, Smith,
Judith, Musselshell, and Yellowstone Rivers in Montana and
the Little Missouri River in North Dakota&mdash;have cut down
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
into the Missouri Plateau, cut broad upland surfaces at many
levels, and established confined valleys with valley floors
flanked by terrace remnants of older floodplains. Locally,
high buttes that are remnants of former interstream divides
rise above the uplands. Large lakes also were formed in most
of these tributary valleys because of damming by the continental
ice sheets.</p>

</div>
<p>West of the Black Hills, in Wyoming, the Tongue River
and the Powder River have excavated the Powder River
Basin and produced similar features (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). The east-flowing
tributaries of the Missouri River&mdash;the Knife, Heart,
and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota and the Grand,
Moreau, Belle Fourche, Cheyenne, Bad, and White Rivers in
South Dakota&mdash;similarly have shaped the landscape.</p>
<p>Most of these rivers flow in broad, old valleys, established
more than 2 million years ago, before the first advance of the
continental ice sheets. Some of these valleys have been
widened by recession of the valley walls by badland development.
Badlands are formed by the cutting action of rivulets
and rills flowing down over a steeply sloping face of soft,
fine-grained material composed mainly of clay and silt. The
intricate carving by thousands of small streams of water produces
the distinctive rounded and gullied terrain we call
badlands. Badlands National Monument in South Dakota
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
(<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>) has been established in the remarkable badlands
terrain cut into the White River Group along the north valley
wall of the White River, and the South Unit of Theodore
Roosevelt National Memorial Park is in the colorful badlands
of the Little Missouri River, formed on the Fort Union
Formation (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>).</p>
<p>The White River also has cut a steep scarp along its southern
wall that is called the Pine Ridge escarpment. This
escarpment defines the boundary between the Missouri
Plateau and the High Plains here.</p>

</div>
<p>The landscape of the Unglaciated Missouri Plateau
has been determined largely by the action of streams,
but in some areas igneous intrusions and volcanoes have produced
small mountain masses that interrupt the plain, and
valley glaciers have modified the valleys in some of these
mountains.</p>

<h3 id="c16">THE COLORADO PIEDMONT</h3>
<p>The Colorado Piedmont lies at the eastern foot of the
Rockies, (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) largely between the South Platte River and
the Arkansas River. The South Platte on the north and the
Arkansas River on the south, after leaving the mountains,
have excavated deeply into the Tertiary (65- to 2-million-year-old)
sedimentary rock layers of the Great Plains in
Colorado and removed great volumes of sediment. At
Denver, the South Platte River has cut downward 1,500 to
2,000 feet to its present level. Three well-formed terrace
levels flank the river&rsquo;s floodplain, and remnants of a number
of well-formed higher land surfaces are preserved between
the river and the mountains. Along the western margin of the
Colorado Piedmont, the layers of older sedimentary rock
have been sharply upturned by the rise of the mountains.
The eroded edges of these upturned layers have been eroded
differentially, so that the hard sandstone and limestone
layers form conspicuous and continuous hogback ridges (<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>).
North of the South Platte River, near the Wyoming
border, a scarp that has been cut on the rocks of the High
Plains marks the northern boundary of the Colorado Piedmont.
Pawnee Buttes (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>) are two of many butte outliers
of the High Plains rocks near that scarp, separated from the
High Plains by erosion as is Scotts Bluff, farther north in
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Nebraska. To the east, about 10 miles northwest of Limon,
Colo., Cedar Point forms a west-jutting prow of the High
Plains.</p>
<p>The Arkansas River similarly has excavated much of the
Tertiary piedmont deposits and cut deeply into the older
Cretaceous marine rocks between Canon City and the Kansas
border. The upturned layers along the mountain front,
marked by hogback ridges and intervening valleys, continue
nearly uninterrupted around the south end of the Front
Range into the embayment in the mountains at Canon City.
Skyline Drive, a scenic drive at Canon City, follows the crest
of the Dakota hogback for a short distance and provides a
fine panorama of the Canon City embayment.</p>

</div>
<p>Extending eastward from the mountain front at Palmer
Lake, a high divide separates the drainage of the South Platte
River from that of the Arkansas River. The crest of the
divide north of Colorado Springs is generally between 7,400
and 7,600 feet in altitude, but Interstate Highway 25 crosses
it at about 7,350 feet, nearly 1,500 feet higher than Colorado
Springs and more than 2,000 feet higher than Denver. From
the crest of the divide to north of Castle Rock, resistant
Oligocene Castle Rock Conglomerate (which is equivalent to
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
part of the White River Group of the High Plains) is preserved
in many places and forms a protective caprock on
mesas and buttes. This picturesque part of the Colorado
Piedmont looks quite different from the excavated valleys of
the South Platte and Arkansas Rivers.</p>
<p>Much of the terrain in the two river valleys has been
smoothed by a nearly continuous mantle of windblown sand
and silt. Northwesterly winds, which frequently blow with
near-hurricane velocities, have whipped fine material from
the floodplains of the streams and spread it eastward and
southeastward over much of the Colorado Piedmont. Well-formed
dunes are not common, but alined gentle ridges of
sand and silt and abundant shallow blowout depressions
inform us of the windblown origin of this cover.</p>

</div>
<p>In the Colorado Piedmont, then, the erosional effects of
streams are the most conspicuous features of the landscape,
but these are enhanced by the steep tilting of the layered
rocks along the western margin as a result of earth movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
and modified by the nearly ubiquitous products of
wind action, which have softened the landscape with a widespread
cover of windblown sand and silt.</p>
<h3 id="c17">PECOS VALLEY</h3>
<p>South of the land of volcanic rocks that is the Raton
section, the Pecos River has cut a broad valley from the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in New Mexico, southward to
the Rio Grande, and has removed the piedmont cover of
Ogallala Formation and cut deeply into the underlying
rocks. The Ogallala Formation capping the High Plains to
the east forms a rimrock at the top of the sharp Mescalero
escarpment, which is the eastern boundary of the Pecos
Valley. (See <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>.) The western boundary of the Pecos
Valley is the eastern base of discontinuous mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The great thickness of Tertiary deposits that formed on the
northern Great Plains did not accumulate here, and the
Pecos River has cut its valley into the older marine sedimentary
rocks. The rocks underlying the surface of much of
the Pecos Valley are upper Paleozoic limestones.</p>
<p>The soluble nature of limestone is responsible for some of
the most spectacular features of the landscape in the Pecos
Valley. For about 10 miles north and 50 miles south of
Vaughn, N. Mex., collapsed solution caverns in upper Paleozoic
limestones have produced an unusual type of topography
called karst. Karst topography is typified by numerous
closely spaced sinks or closed depressions, some of
which are very deep holes, caused by the collapse of the roof
of a cave or solution cavity into the underground void,
leaving hills, spines, or hummocks at the top of the intervening
walls or ribs separating the depressions.</p>
<p>Although the karst in the vicinity of Vaughn is perhaps the
most conspicuous solution phenomenon, sinks and caves are
common throughout the Pecos Valley. At Bottomless Lakes
State Park east of Roswell, N. Mex., seven lakes occupy
large sinkholes caused by the solution of salt and gypsum in
underlying rocks.</p>
<p>The most spectacular example of solution of limestone by
ground water is Carlsbad Caverns, N. Mex., one of the most
beautiful caves in the world. This celebrated solution cavity
is preserved in a national park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The Pecos River along much of its present course flows in
a vertical-walled canyon with limestone rims. The Canadian
River, flowing eastward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains,
has cut a deep canyon along the northern part of the
Pecos Valley section. The sharp rims of the Dakota Sandstone
at the Canadian escarpment, north of the Canadian
River, form the northern boundary of the Pecos Valley
section.</p>
<p>The sharp, northeast-trending broken flexure called the
Border Hills that is crossed by U. S. Highway 70-380 about
20 miles west of Roswell is a unique landform of the Pecos
Valley. This markedly linear upfolded (anticlinal) structure
forms a ridge more than 30 miles long and about 200 feet
high.</p>
<p>As in the Colorado Plateau, windblown sand and silt
mantle the landscape in many places, but the greatest accumulations
are along the base of the Mescalero escarpment
at the northeast and southeast corners of the Pecos Valley
section.</p>
<p>East of the Pecos River, in the southeast part of the Pecos
Valley, the underlying rocks have yielded much oil and
potash. Oil fields are common east of Artesia and Carlsbad,
and potash is mined east of Carlsbad.</p>
<p>The Pecos and Canadian Rivers and their tributaries have
created the general outline of the landscape of the Pecos
Valley, but underground solution of limestone by ground
water and the collapse of roofs of these cavities have contributed
much detail to the surface that characterizes the Pecos
Valley today.</p>
<h3 id="c18">EDWARDS PLATEAU</h3>
<p>South of the Pecos Valley section, the Pecos River continues
its journey to the Rio Grande in a steep-walled canyon
cut 400 to 500 feet below the level of a plateau surface of Cretaceous
limestone from which little has been stripped except
a thin Tertiary cover of Ogallala Formation (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>). To the
east, the plateau has been similarly incised by the Devils
River and the West Nueces and Nueces Rivers. East of the
Nueces to the escarpment formed by the Balcones fault zone,
the southern part of the Edwards Plateau has been intricately
dissected by the Frio, Sabinal, Medina, Guadalupe, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Pedernales Rivers and their tributary systems. San Antonio
and Austin, Tex., are located on the Coastal Plain at the edge
of the Balcones fault zone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">

<p class="caption"><i>Figure 30.&mdash;Rio Grande and the flat-lying limestone layers of the
Edwards Plateau downstream from the mouth of the Pecos
River. Mexico on the left side of picture. Photograph by
V. L. Freeman, U. S. Geological Survey.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Pecos River, and to a lesser extent the Devils and
Nueces Rivers, particularly in their lower courses, have entrenched
themselves deeply in the plateau in remarkable
meandering courses of a type that is usually found only in
broad, low-lying floodplains. These stream courses reflect
the stream environment prior to regional uplift.</p>
<p>Sinkholes pit the relatively undissected limestone plateau
surface in the northeast part of the Edwards Plateau, and
some underground solution cavities in the limestone are well-known
caves, such as the Caverns of Sonora, southwest of
Sonora, Tex.</p>
<p>Oil and gas fields are widely developed in the northern
part of the Edwards Plateau, but only cattle ranches are
found in the bare southern part.</p>
<p>Ancient oceans deposited the limestones that now cap the
Edwards Plateau; streams planed off the surface of the flat-lying
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
limestone layers and entrenched themselves in steep-walled
valleys; and ground water dissolved the limestone
and created the solution cavities that are the caves and sinks
of the Edwards Plateau. Water has created this landscape.</p>
<h3 id="c19">PLAINS BORDER SECTION</h3>
<p>The Missouri Plateau, the Colorado Piedmont, the Pecos
Valley, and the Edwards Plateau all were outlined by streams
that flowed from the mountains. On the eastern border of the
Great Plains, however, headward cutting by streams that
have their source areas in the High Plains has dissected a
large area, mainly in Kansas. This Plains Border Section
comprises a number of east-trending river valleys&mdash;of the
Republican, Solomon, Saline, Smoky Hill, Arkansas, Medicine
Lodge, Cimarron, and North Canadian Rivers&mdash;and
interstream divides, most of which are intricately dissected.</p>
<p>North of the Arkansas River, the east-flowing Republican,
Solomon, Saline, and Smoky Hill Rivers have incised themselves
a few hundred feet below the Tertiary High Plains
surface and have developed systems of closely spaced tributary
draws. The interstream divides are narrow, and the
tributary heads nearly meet at the divides. This intricately
dissected part of the Plains Border section is called the
Smoky Hills. Some isolated buttes of Cretaceous rocks left in
the upper valley of the Smoky Hill River are called the
Monument Rocks. A large area of rounded boulders exposed
by erosion south of the Solomon River, southwest of
Minneapolis, Kans., is called &ldquo;Rock City.&rdquo; These boulders
originated as resistant nodules (concretions) within the Cretaceous
rocks that contained them.</p>
<p>South of the Arkansas River is a broad, nearly flat upland
sometimes referred to as the Great Bend Plains. The Medicine
Lodge River has cut headward into the southeastern part
of the Great Bend Plains and created a thoroughly dissected
topography in Triassic red rocks that is locally called the Red
Hills. In a few places, badlands have formed in the Red Hills.</p>
<p>Some large sinks or collapse depressions have formed
because of solution of salt and gypsum at depth by ground
water. Big and Little Basins, in Clark County in south-central
Kansas, were formed in this way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Sand dunes have accumulated in places, especially near
stream valleys. Dunes are common, for example, along the
north side of the North Canadian River.</p>
<p>Oil and gas fields are widely developed in the southeast
part of the Plains Border section&mdash;in the Smoky Hills, the
Great Bend Plains, and the Red Hills.</p>
<p>The Plains Border section, like the Missouri Plateau, the
Colorado Piedmont, and the Pecos Valley, is primarily a
product of stream dissection. The differences in the outstanding
landforms of the section are mainly the result of differences
in the hardness of the eroded rocks.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">EPILOGUE</span></h2>
<p>The Great Plains, as we have seen, is many things. It contains
thick layers of rock that formed in oceans, and younger
layers of rocks deposited by streams. These rocks have been
affected by earth movements and injected by hot molten
rock, some of which reached the surface as volcanic rock.
The rocks have been carved by streams, dissolved by ground
water, partly covered by glaciers, and blown by winds. All
of these agents have played important roles in determining
the landscape and the landforms of the Great Plains. But the
streams were the master agent. They formed the great depositional
plain that was to become the Great Plains, and then
began to destroy it&mdash;leaving only the High Plains to remind
us of what it was. Those long miles we travel across the High
Plains are a journey through history&mdash;geologic history.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
